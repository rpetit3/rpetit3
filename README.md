### Yo! 👋

Hello, I'm Robert! I currently work as a bioinformatician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University. My work involves developing [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), a bacterial genome analysis pipeline, and providing bioinformatic support for the [EMERGENT Group](https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/) and collaborators.

I am a big advocate of using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/), specifically [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/). If you have a bioinformatic tool you think others would find useful, please take the time to submit a recipe to Bioconda. And, if you need help, please reach out to the [Bioconda Team](https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes/issues) or myself ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/rpetit3)). I think you'll find some people willing to help out!

- 💻 Things I use daily: Nextflow, Conda, Unix, Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- 💬 Ask me about: [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the third Robert, in a line of Bobs
- 🔥 Hot take: *Pecan* is pronounced **PEE-CAN**!
