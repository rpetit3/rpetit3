### Yo! 👋

Hello, I'm Robert Petit (*puh-teet, not pet-it*)! I currently work as a bioinformatician in the Wyoming Public Health Laboratory. In my personal time I am continuing to develop [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), a bacterial genome analysis pipeline.

- 💻 Things I use daily: Nextflow, Conda, Unix, Python
- 💬 Ask me about: [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the third Robert, in a line of Bobs
- 🔥 Hot take: *Pecan* is pronounced **PEE-CAN**!
