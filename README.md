### Yo! 👋

Hello, I'm Robert! I currently work as a bioinformatician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Emory University. My work involves developing [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/), a bacterial genome analysis pipeline, and providing bioinformatic support for the [EMERGENT Group](https://read-lab-confederation.github.io/).

- 💻 Things I use daily: Nextflow, Conda, Unix, Python
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- 💬 Ask me about: [Bactopia](https://bactopia.github.io/) and [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm the third Robert, in a line of Bobs
- 🔥 Hot take: *Pecan* is pronounced **PEE-CAN**!
